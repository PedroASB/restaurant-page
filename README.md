## About the Project

This project is part of the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). You can check out other projects that I've built in my [fullstack-journey](https://github.com/PedroASB/fullstack-journey) repository.

**Interesting fact:** this fictional restaurant "The King Rocks" is a tribute to a real restaurant from my hometown in Brazil. It was called "King's Rock" and sadly closed its doors around late 2013.
